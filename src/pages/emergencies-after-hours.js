    <h1>Emergencies &amp; After Hours</h1>
    <h3>If your child is experiencing a life threatening emergency, please call 911 or go to your nearest Emergency Room.</h3>
    <h2>After Hours Coverage</h2>
    <p>If you would like to reach the on call physician about an urgent matter that cannot wait until regular office hours, we are available after 5 pm on weeknights, and throughout the weekend. To reach a physician please call our office at 617-232-2811. If you do not receive a call back in the expected time, please call our office again.</p>
    <p>We are available to see your child for urgent medical issues on Saturday, Sundays, and holidays. These visits are by appointment. Please call our office at 617-232-2811 and the on-call physician will call you back either to give you advice or to schedule an office visit.</p>
    <p>We are available 24 hours/day, 365 days/year to care for our patients. If you are considering going to an urgent care center please call us first. The best after-hours care for your child comes from a pediatrician who knows your child or who works closely with your childâ€™s pediatrician.</p>
    <p>For weekend appointments your child will be seen in our office or in the Newton office of our weekend covering group.</p>
