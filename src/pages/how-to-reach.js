    <h1>How to Reach Your Pediatrician</h1>
    <h2>Weekdays: 9am - 5pm</h2>
    <p>To reach your child's pediatrician please call our office at 617-232-2811. Our staff will make an appointment for you or ensure your childâ€™s pediatrician calls you back as soon as possible.</p>
    <h2>After Hours/Weekends</h2>
    <p>This time is for urgent matters that cannot wait until regular office hours. Please call our office, at 617-232-2811 and your call will be answered by one of the pediatricians from our office or one of the physicians from our covering pediatric practice in Newton Centre.</p>
    <p>We do not use or respond to text messages or emails from patients. We have found that when a family has medical questions, the best way to communicate is in person or by phone. We are always happy talk to you in person or by telephone.</p>
    <p><strong>If your child is experiencing a life threatening emergency, please call 911 or go to your nearest Emergency Room.</strong></p>
