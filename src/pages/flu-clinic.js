    <h1>Flu Shot Clinic Information</h1>

    <p>
      We are happy to let you know that we will begin a series of multiple flu
      vaccine clinics starting in September. We will notify you about your
      child's scheduled day and time. We will have ample supply of vaccines and
      will offer clinics throughout September, October, and November until 100%
      of our patients are vaccinated.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unlike past flu clinics, this year the clinics will include smaller groups
      of patients, scheduled time slots outside of school and work hours, and
      will occur out-of-doors to ensure health and safety for our patients.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our early September flu clinics will focus on our medically high risk
      patients and after that we will systematically schedule everyone else.
      Each of you will get vaccinated in plenty of time before the flu season
      begins and we have enough supply for all of our patients.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>
        No need to call and schedule: We will notify you about your child's
        scheduled day and time.
      </strong>{" "}
      When you are notified about your child's flu clinic appointment, please
      read the whole email. It will contain important information about the flu
      clinic such as:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>What time to arrive</li>
      <li>Where to park</li>
      <li>What to bring</li>
      <li>What to wear</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You will be required to bring a "ticket"/flu clinic form. The form must be
      filled out in advance for each patient.{" "}

      </a>
    </p>

    <p>
      We will NOT be offering lollipops this year, so if your child enjoys the
      usual lollipop after the shot, we ask you to purchase that in advance and
      offer it at home. We do not want children to take off the mask to eat or
      drink.
    </p>

    <p>
      We will be able vaccinate parents and nannies who sign up and pay in
      advance. We know many of you count on us as your source for your flu shot
      and are happy to continue that this year.
